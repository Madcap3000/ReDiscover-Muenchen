## Inspiration
We want to help you discover Munich from a perspective often lost during daily life.
(Also we wanted to go on a tour through sewers)

## What it does
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea behind our project was to 
open users eyes to interesting locations right beside them. As simple as 
it is to search for such locations, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the 
abundance of choices. And even worse: less famous structures are easy to be
overlooked next to flashy and famous ones.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this problem we are creating a 
simple app, that draws the users attention to the closest interesting locations and 
gives some general information on them (but not too much, as to not overwhelm them
and give them an incentive to visit it themselves).

It shows those points on an interactive map allowing to find the location to visit. 
Since Munich has a bountiful offer of such points, we group 
them by proximity depending on the view to reduce noise-pollution.
POI further away and other markers are also hidden for the same reason.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the intuitive interface and 
carefully presented options we hope to make any simple walk in the city 
to become more interesting and informative.

## How we built it
Through hell and fire:)

## Challenges we ran into
- We couldn't find a DB with historic sites in Munich.
- We lost our designer and had to learn a lot.
- We had problems with customising the OpenStreetMap.
- Mobile styling (as always).
- Centering div's 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We have managed to create a huge database in less than 12 hours.
- We found a visually pleasing map representation of Munich.
- We used our (mostly self-made) "massive" database and the map to create an interactive and intuitive view.

## What we learned
On our journey we had to learn how to work with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet plugin.
On top of that we learned the importance of sleep, and how not to do in the future.

## What's next for ReDiscover MÃ¼nchen
- We would like to improve the database structure and rethink the data selection(add entry fees where they exist, average/predicted time to enjoy the POI)
- We would work on reorganising the access to the database, to make it faster and less cost-effective
- We would make the selection of the points of interest to be shown smarter with the help of tourism and historical experts
- We would like to broaden the database to also include limited-time events like exhibitions or markets
- We would work on integrating pathfinding algorithms and (once available) the MVV API to accurately calculate time to reach each point of interest and help users to find locations
