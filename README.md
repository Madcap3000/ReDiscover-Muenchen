## Inspiration
We were inspired by the sewer tour.

## What it does
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea behind our project was to open users eyes to interesting locations right beside then. As simple as it is to search for such locations, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the abundance of choices. And even worser: less famous structures are easy to be overlooked beside flashy and famous once.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are creating a simple app, that draws user attentions to the closest interesting locations and gives some general information on them.
It shows those points on an interactive map allowing to find next interesting location to see. 
POI further away and other markers are hidden to reduce the information overload.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through it, we hope to make any simple walk in the city to become more interesting and informative.

## How we built it
Through hell and fire:)

## Challenges we ran into
- We couldn't find a DB with historic sites in Munich.
- We lost our designer and had to learn a lot.
- We had problems with customising the OpenStreetMap.

## Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe have managed to create a huge database in less than 12 hours.
We combined visually interesting map representation of Munich.

## What we learned
On our journey we had to learn how to work with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet plugin.

## What's next for ReDiscover MÃ¼nchen
- We would like to improve the database structure and rethink the data selection
- We would work on reorganising the access to the database, to make it faster and less cost-effective
- We would make the selection of the points of interest to be shown smarter with the help of tourism and historical experts
- We would like to broaden the database to also include limited-time events like exhibitions or markets
- We would work on integrating pathfinding algorithms to accurately calculate time to reach each point of interest and help users to find locations
