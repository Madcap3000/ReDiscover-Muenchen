## Inspiration
We were inspired by the sewer tour
## What it does
It allows citizens or visitors of Munich to find historical or interesting locations. As simple as it is to search for interesting places to visit, it can be tiring and often overwhelming with how much each city has to offer. Our idea is to present and draw attention to the overlooked historic sites by showing the closest points of interest and giving some info on them on an interactive map. POI further away are hidden to reduce the information overload. Through it we hope to make any simple walk in the city to become more interesting and informative.
## How we built it
Through hell and fire:)
## Challenges we ran into
- We couldn't find a DB with historic sites in Munich
- We lost our designer and had to learn a lot
- We had problems with customising the OpenStreetMap
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- we have managed to create a huge database in less than 12 hours
## What we learned
- how to work with TypeScript
- how to work with OpenStreetMap
## What's next for ReDiscover MÃ¼nchen
- we would like to improve the database, and maybe reorganise the POI
- we would work on reorganising the access to the database, to make it faster and less cost-effective
- we would make the selection of the points of interest to be shown smarter with the help of tourism and historical experts
